# Chroma Course FAQ Section

This project is a part of the Chroma Course website, an online learning community with thousands of classes for creative and curious people. The FAQ section is designed to answer common questions about Chroma Course, such as what it is, what you can learn from it, and whether you can teach on it.

The FAQ section is implemented in React and uses the `Disclosure` component from Headless UI for the FAQ items. Each FAQ item consists of a question and an answer, which are defined in an array of objects. The `Disclosure.Button` displays the question, and the `Disclosure.Panel` displays the answer when the button is clicked.

## Project Setup

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
